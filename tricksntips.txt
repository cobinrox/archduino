1) The Arduino IDE for Windows is not reliable for nanos; be sure to downgrade the IDE version to 1.8.7 at the highest.
When uploading code through the IDE, you may have to change the IDE's Processor settings (in the Tools drop down)
from AT to ATMega to ATMega Old and back and forth.  This issue is documented on the arduino forums. 

2) Certain flavors of Nano cards are finicky about starting up when powered from stand-alone power supply and
require you to press the reset button on the card before the code will run.  To avoid this issue, add a
1-second delay in the start up section of the loop.(see https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=515895.0)
